- `panic` macro, pointing it at a `pub macro` in `pub mod panic`
- `#[macro_export] macro` (slightly different rules to `macro_rules!` version)
- new `asm` macro
- `pub use bool` to import the primitive type, not a module
- Trait aliases
- Or patterns
  > Hard question between having combinatorial explosion from expanding or patterns early (in HIR generation), or serious changes in destructuring logic.
- Extended use of const generics
  - Now need value inferrence
- New language-provided trait impls
- Lots of new `const fn` constructs
- Updated `?` operator
- Use of `!` as a type more (`e.into()` where `E: Into<!>`)
