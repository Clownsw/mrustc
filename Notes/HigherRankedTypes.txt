mrustc vtable types and paths with HRTBs/HRLs.

`dyn Fn(&T)->&U` becomes `dyn for<'a> Fn<(&'a T,),Output=&'a U>`
- Lifetime must be kept generic until method invoke.
- OR, just ignore those lifetime params completely - the params end up in the vtable's `for<'a> fn(self: &Self, arg: (&'a T,)) -> &'a U`


VTable type needs the HRL present? Maybe it can just be an unused lifetime
- Currently, vtables are normal structs with hidden names
- Could be a magic associated type that has no name?
  > Need to get the fields of the type.
  > More custom code?
- So, a struct with function pointers that use the HRLs
  > The function pointers could have the sensible lifetime annotations for the call...
  > But then how do they match the trait's path params?
  > The trait/vtable path still needs HRLs.

What about the vtable path? (Currently an associated static)
- Again, could stay as that magic path?
- Needs the HRLs, but those could be in the UfcsKnown?

BUT, what happens when it's used?
- This problem always exists, at use-time the HRLs need to be expanded.


```mir
fn foo(input: &'_ dyn for<'a> Fn<(&'a (i32,i32),),Output=&'a i32>)
{
	let temp1: (i32,i32);
	let vtable: for<'a> Fn#vtable<(&'a (i32,i32),), &'a i32>;
	let ptr: & ();
	bb0: {
		vtable = DSTMETA input;
		ptr = DSTPTR input;
		temp1 = (1i32,2i32,);
		borrow = CALL (vtable*.2)(ptr, &temp1) goto bb1 else bb_panic;	// Here is where the lifetimes need to be expanded
	}
	bb1: {
		temp1 = (3i32,4i32,);
		borrow = CALL (vtable*.2)(ptr, &temp1) goto bb2 else bb_panic;	// Here is where the lifetimes need to be expanded
	}
	bb2: {
		return;
	}
}
```

```rust
struct Fn#vtable<Args, Output>
{
	vtable_common: VtableCommon,
	call: fn(&(), Args) -> Output,
}
```
```rust
struct for<'a>  Fn#vtable<(&'a (i32,i32),), &'a i32>
{
	vtable_common: VtableCommon,
	call: fn(&self, (&'a (i32,i32),)) -> &'a i32,
}

struct Fn#vtable<'a, (&'a (i32,i32),), &'a i32>
{
	vtable_common: VtableCommon,
	call: for<'a> fn(&self, (&'a (i32,i32),)) -> &'a i32,
}
```


Challenge: Two layers of HRLs present (one in the vtable path, the other within the function pointer)
- 
```rust
trait Foo<A>
{
	type Output1;
	type Output2;
	fn foo(&self, v: A) -> (&Output1, Output2);
}
struct Foo#vtable<Args, Output1,Output2>
{
	vtable_common: VtableCommon,
	call: for<'s> foo(&'s (), Args) -> (&'s Output1, Output2),
}
struct for<'a> Foo#vtable<(&'a (i32,i32),), u32, &'a i32>
{
	vtable_common: VtableCommon,
	call: for<'s> foo(&'s (), (&'a (i32,i32),)) -> (&'s u32, &'a i32),
}
```

Generalised issue, two layers of function pointers.
- This requires each generic reference to also point at the target generic block
  - Option: A relative index - this breaks with type inference/expansion?
    - TODO: Example of breakage.
  - Option: Direct reference (shared pointer, or a global block identifer)
    - Global ID would need to have the crate ID and a within-crate ID, but how would that handle function pointers properly?
    - I guess shared pointers?
  - Any special handling needed for cloned HRL blocks?
  - Option: Direct reference #2
    - A global reference number, never cloned

General solution
- Add an ID (runtime allocated) to every `HIR::GenericParams`
  - This ID _could_ be globally unique (allocated per crate, and include a per-crate ID)
  - Or, just have a global pool and compact/map during writeout/read
  - Want the ID to be small-ish? `GenericRef` is currently a `RcString` (single pointer) plus a `u32`
    - It's usually used in enums with three pointes (e.g. vector/string)
    - Adding another `u32` shouldn't have much (or any) impact.
- Whenever expanding generics, search up a stack for the relevant ID
